Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) is unaware that in the years since his model went out of production, he's become a rare and valuable collector's item. An avid toy collector (voice of Wayne Knight) decides that he wants Woody for his collection and swipes him, so Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen), Hamm (voice of John Ratzenberger), Rex (voice of Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (voice of Jim Varney), and Mr. Potato Head (voice of Don Rickles) venture forth to rescue their kidnapped friend before Andy returns.

If this seems to be a sterile, mechanical means of moviemaking, be assured that the film is as chock-full of heart and warmth as any Disney cartoon feature. The star of the proceedings is Woody, a pull-string cowboy toy belonging to a wide-eyed youngster named Andy. Whenever Andy's out of the room, Woody revels in his status as the boy's number one toy. His supremacy is challenged by a high-tech, space-ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear, who, unlike Woody and his pals, believes that he is real and not merely a plaything. The rivalry between Woody and Buzz hilariously intensifies during the first half of the film, but when the well-being of Andy's toys is threatened by a nasty next-door neighbor kid named Sid -- whose idea of fun is feeding stuffed dolls to his snarling dog and reconstructing his own toys into hideous mutants -- Woody and Buzz join forces to save the day. Superb though the computer animation may be, what really heightens Toy Story are the voice-over performances by such celebrities as Tom Hanks (as Woody), Tim Allen (as Buzz), and Don Rickles (as an appropriately acerbic Mr. Potato Head). Director John Lasseter earned a special achievement Academy Award, while Randy Newman landed an Oscar nomination for his evocative musical score. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi","updated_at":"2013-03-25T05:18:03Z"},{"audience_rating":58,"created_at":"2013-03-25T05:19:10Z","critic_rating":38,"critics_consensus":null,"dvd_release_date":null,"facebook_id":null,"id":8,"imdb_id":"0103112","mpaa_rating":"R","name":"Toy Soldiers","poster_picture_url":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/10/91/90/10919071_ori.jpg","release_date":"1991","rotten_tomatoes_id":"13851","runtime":112,"studio_id":5,"synopsis":"Dead Poets Society and Die Hard bash heads in this action drama set in a Northeastern prep school. The film opens as a crazed Central American terrorist, Luis Cali (Andrew Divoff), goes on a shooting spree, attempting to gain his drug baron father's release from extradition to the United States. The following sequence introduces some malcontented rich kids from the prep school --Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton), the son of a New Jersey mob leader; Billy Tepper (Sean Astin), a reprobate who has been to four boarding schools in as many years; Snuffy Bradbury (Keith Coogan), whose rich banker father is the chairman of the Republican Party; Ricardo Montoya (George Perez), the son of a big-shot lawyer; and Hank Giles (T.E. Russell), whose father is the head of the House Armed Services Committee. The boys disregard their studies and spend their waking hours giving Dean Parker (Louis Gossett Jr.) a hard time. The two storylines collide when Luis, with a group of terrorist goons, make their way across the U.S. border and invade the boarding school, planning to take hostage the son of his father's judge. But the authorities have already removed the boy from danger, so Luis and the terrorists decide to hold the entire student body hostage until their demands are met. Working with the FBI and the special government forces, the rebellious groups of boys have to devise a plan to short-circuit the hostage situation. ~ Paul Brenner, Rovi","updated_at":"2013-03-25T05:19:24Z"},{"audience_rating":0,"created_at":"2013-03-25T05:19:24Z","critic_rating":-1,"critics_consensus":null,"dvd_release_date":null,"facebook_id":null,"id":9,"imdb_id":null,"mpaa_rating":"Unrated","name":"The Toy Dolls: Our Last DVD?","poster_picture_url":"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif","release_date":"2004","rotten_tomatoes_id":"770829753","runtime":null,"studio_id":null,"synopsis":"","updated_at":"2013-03-25T05:19:24Z"},{"audience_rating":55,"created_at":"2013-03-25T05:19:29Z","critic_rating":11,"critics_consensus":null,"dvd_release_date":null,"facebook_id":null,"id":10,"imdb_id":"0084809","mpaa_rating":"PG","name":"The Toy","poster_picture_url":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/10/91/90/10919075_ori.jpg","release_date":"1982","rotten_tomatoes_id":"11247","runtime":102,"studio_id":6,"synopsis":"In The Toy, director Richard Donner and screenwriter Carol Sobieski update the 1976 Pierre Richard farce Le Jouet as a vehicle for comedian Richard Pryor. Pryor stars as out-of-work journalist Jack Brown, who's hit with the sudden realization that his idle book writing won't pay a 10,000-dollar sum necessary to keep his house from going to auction. Desperate, he is improbably hired as a cleaning lady in the offices of rich businessman and newspaper magnate U.S. Bates (Jackie Gleason). Running afoul of Bates' quick temper, Jack gets the axe, but is later spotted goofing around in a Bates-owned toy store by Bates' bratty son, Eric (Scott Schwartz), who's spending his annual week together with his estranged father. Taking his father's offer that he may have \"anything in the store\" quite literally, the spoiled kid asks for Jack as his personal toy for the week. Initially unwilling to be treated as a possession, Jack soon agrees after Bates offers to pay him enough to climb out of debt. When Eric's idea of fun includes dumping buckets of booby-trapped oatmeal on Jack's head and riding down the stairs of his father's mansion with Jack riding shotgun in a miniature car, it tests both Jack's patience and his resolve. But Jack discovers that Bates is ignoring Eric, which strengthens the bond between them and prompts them to seek revenge on the big jerk. ~ Derek Armstrong, Rovi","updated_at":"2013-03-25T05:19:41Z"},{"audience_rating":29,"created_at":"2013-03-25T05:19:41Z","critic_rating":-1,"critics_consensus":null,"dvd_release_date":null,"facebook_id":null,"id":11,"imdb_id":"0431340","mpaa_rating":"Unrated","name":"Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys (Demonic Toys 3)","poster_picture_url":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/14/63/11146322_ori.jpg","release_date":"2004","rotten_tomatoes_id":"770671535","runtime":95,"studio_id":7,"synopsis":"This made-for-cable shocker was the evil alien spawn of two separate Full Moon film series, Puppet Master and The Demonic Toys.

Donald O'Connor is the kindly, gentle Kenneth Zevo, founder of Zevo Toys. The workers love him and the love they feel for Zevo comes through in the lovingly cute toys they produce. His son Leslie (Robin Williams) is an eccentric inventor who concentrates on coming up with different styles of plastic vomit and over-sized ears. His addle-headed daughter Alsatia (Joan Cusack) enjoys trying out all of Leslie's inventions. But their innocent, idyllic existence is soon to be shattered. Kenneth is dying and he is reluctant to bequeath the factory to the immature hands of Leslie and Alsatia. He finally decides to pass on his factory to his three-star general brother (Michael Gambon), reasoning that the general will run the factory efficiently and prod Leslie and Alsatia into adulthood. When Kenneth dies, the general and his army surplus son Patrick (LL Cool J) immediately turn Zevo Toys into an oppressive fascistic environment. The general also stops production of the innocent Zevo products and forces the workers to manufacture violent interactive video games and sadistic war toys. Leslie must rouse himself out of his over-long childhood to preserve the tradition of Zevo Toys. Although Toys did not fare well at the box office, it features a stunning combination of production design by Ferdinando Scarfiotti and art direction by Edward Richardson. ~ Paul Brenner, Rovi","updated_at":"2013-03-25T05:20:12Z"},{"audience_rating":0,"created_at":"2013-03-25T05:20:13Z","critic_rating":-1,"critics_consensus":null,"dvd_release_date":null,"facebook_id":null,"id":13,"imdb_id":null,"mpaa_rating":"Unrated","name":"Toy Dolls","poster_picture_url":"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif","release_date":"","rotten_tomatoes_id":"770915315","runtime":60,"studio_id":null,"synopsis":"","updated_at":"2013-03-25T05:20:13Z"}]
